The Story Behind the App
Why I Made This App
A friend of mine was always struggling to decide what to eat. I created this app to make it easier for her (and others) to figure out meals based on the time of day.

What I Wanted to Achieve
Build a Kotlin-based Android app that suggests meals based on the time of day.

Use if-else statements (in Kotlin) to manage meal suggestions.

Automate testing and building using GitHub Actions.

Ensure that the app code is clear, simple, and easy to understand.
